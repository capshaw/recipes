    "steps" : [
       "Start marinating the tofu in the mixture of the soy sauce and the chili garlic sauce. You'll want all sides to be rotated through the marinade for a grand total of around ten minutes (too long and the tofu will be quite salty).",
       "Wash and cut your vegetables into small chucks while waiting for the tofu. You aren't going to want to do this later, so do it now. Small is good because it allows the vegetables to cook faster.",
       "Bake the tofu on a baking pan for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, flipping once half-way. In the meanwhile, you can start the sauce if you'd like.",
       "Once the tofu is done, start some rice cooking.",
       "Cut the tofu into long, thin, strips.",
       "Start cooking the tofu in oil on the stove. Once you feel it is crispy enough, toss in the veggies and start stir frying. When the vegetables look done, add the sauce to the pan. You're done, enjoy!"
